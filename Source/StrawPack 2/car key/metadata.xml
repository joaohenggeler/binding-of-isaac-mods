Adds a brand new trinket to the game!

While held, if Isaac collides with a locked object with a speed greater than his current maximum possible walking speed, it will be unlocked.

Locked objects include: chests, doors (excluding Mega Satan's Door) and lock blocks*.

* Due to API limitations, these will only be unlocked when you reenter the room.

This trinket will be part of the StrawPack 2 item pack. Stay tuned!
