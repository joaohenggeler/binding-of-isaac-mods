Adds a brand new trinket into the game!

While held, every amount of damage taken has a 50% to either be doubled or ignored.

Synergizes with Mom's Box: same penalty but instead of ignoring the damage, Isaac gets healed for that amount.

This trinket will part of the StrawPack 2 item pack. Stay tuned!
