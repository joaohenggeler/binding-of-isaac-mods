Adds a brand new follower to the Treasure Room pool!

When Isaac takes damage, Mystery Egg breaks and releases a charmed enemy. The type of enemy spawned depends on how many rooms have been cleared with the familiar (see below).

Spawned monsters have more health than normal.

Synergizes with BFFS!: spawned enemies turn into a random champion type.

[u]Note:[/u] some monsters can turn into other variants, e.g: Mulligans -&gt; Mulligoon, Mulliboom, meaning the list is slightly longer than the one above. </description>
