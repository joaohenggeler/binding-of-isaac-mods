    <description>[i]&quot;Thematic spoils&quot;[/i]

Adds a brand new trinket to the game!

While held, bosses have a 40% chance to drop items thematically related to them instead of their usual ones.

The trinket can be dropped mid-fight to prevent any items from being replaced.

Mom will [i]always[/i] drop The Polaroid and The Negative first.

Drops from other sources such as Mystery Gift and Eden's Soul while in a Boss Room are also affected.

Synergizes with Mom's Box: chance is 80% instead.

This trinket will be part of the StrawPack 2 item pack. Stay tuned!

Art by Aczom and code by Strawrat.
