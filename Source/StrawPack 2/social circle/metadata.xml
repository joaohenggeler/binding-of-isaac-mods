Adds a brand new trinket to the game!

While held, familiars that would normally follow Isaac will now orbit him instead.

This only applies to followers in the familiar chain that follows Isaac. One exception to this is Isaac's Heart, which would always follow Isaac.

Might have no effect on modded familiars.

[u]NOTE: the trinket's sprite in the demo videos is larger than the currently used one. See the images above for its real size ingame.[/u]

This trinket will be part of the StrawPack 2 item pack. Stay tuned!
