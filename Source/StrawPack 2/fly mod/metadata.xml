Adds a brand new active item to the Treasure Room and Shop pools!

Charge: 1 room.

While held, a robotic fly will orbit Isaac, dealing light contact damage and blocking enemy shots.

After activating the item, Fly Mod will leave the orbit and dash for a few seconds, dealing a high amount of damage.

After the fly slows down, it will bounce off the walls for the remainder of the room, dealing a medium amount of damage.

Fly Mod confuses fly enemies that get close to it. It also turns Blue Flies into Locusts if they stay close to it for a few seconds.

Every time Fly Mod kills an enemy, there is 50% for a Blue Fly to spawn.

Synergizes with BFFS: increased area of effect for enemies and Blue Flies + the number of Blue Flies spawned after killing an enemy is increased by the amount of BFFS! items.
