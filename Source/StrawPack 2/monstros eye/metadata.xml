    <description>[i]&quot;Summon Monstro II&quot;[/i]

Adds a brand new active item to the Treasure Room pool!

Charge: 6 rooms.

When used, summons Monstro 2 to drop from above, landing on enemies, dealing 120 damage to them and destroying obstacles like rocks.

After dropping down, Monstro 2 will shoot a Brimstone laser with the player's tear effects and damage.

If no enemies are present, Monstro 2 will fall where Isaac is. He won't, however, home towards the player while falling.

While held, there's a 15% chance to shoot concussive tears, causing enemies to walk around randomly.

This item will be part of the StrawPack 2 item pack. Stay tuned!
