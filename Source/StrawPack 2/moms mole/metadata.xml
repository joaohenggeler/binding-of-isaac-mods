    <description>[i]&quot;Burrowing tears + shot speed up&quot;[/i]

Adds a brand new passive item to the Treasure Room pool!

Shot speed up + slight range down.

Isaac's tears now burrow underground at the end of their range. After enough have been burrowed, they'll all reemerge at once with combined tear effects.

This item will be part of the StrawPack 2 item pack. Stay tuned!
