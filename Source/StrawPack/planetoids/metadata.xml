Sun: orbits Isaac and has a 1/5 chance to apply burn on contact. Turns tears into Fire Mind tears when they pass through it.

Earth: orbits the Sun and has a 1/5 chance to spawn a small puddle of blue creep on contact. Turns Fire Mind tears back into regular tears.

Moon: orbits the Earth and has a 1/5 chance to apply confusion on contact.
