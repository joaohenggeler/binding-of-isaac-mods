Adds a brand new orbital to the Treasure Room pool!

Gives Isaac two fly orbitals:

A blue-colored one that only moves when Isaac shoots and whose contact damage scales with Isaac's damage.
A pink-colored one that only moves when Isaac moves and whose contact damage is constant.

Although the blue fly's base damage is less than the pink one's damage, it can potentially overtake it with enough damage ups.

This item is part of the StrawPack item pack.
