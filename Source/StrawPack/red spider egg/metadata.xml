Adds a brand new trinket to the game!

While held, Isaac gains a damage and speed boost and every enemy projectile has a 1/10 to turn into a spider when spawned.

Synergizes with Mom's Box: boosts are doubled but so is the likelihood of a projectile turning into a spider.

This trinket is part of the StrawPack item pack.
