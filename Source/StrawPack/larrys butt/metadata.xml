While held, when damaged down to half a heart, if the damage was done by a projectile, a poop shield spawns around Isaac. Otherwise, Isaac releases a poisonous fart.

Synergizes with Meconium, Midas Touch and Bozo: poop spawned can be black, golden or rainbow, respectively.

This trinket is part of the StrawPack item pack.
