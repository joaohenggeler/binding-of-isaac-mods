    <description>[i]&quot;HP up + temporary help&quot;[/i]

Adds a brand new passive item to the Boss pool!

Gives Isaac one half filled heart and 2-3 blue flies when picked up.

For as long as Isaac doesn't get hit, green creep will spawn under him. After one hit, this one effect goes away until Isaac goes down a floor.

This item is part of the StrawPack item pack.
