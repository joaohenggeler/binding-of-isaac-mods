  <!--  Isaac.GetCardIdByName() expects you to pass it the hud and not the name-->

  <!-- here's the deal, you have to put your gfx with ui_cardfronts.anm2 and it's spritesheet in the content folder (where pocketitems.xml is); if you have any other stuff like items or enemies put their gfx folder under resources where they would normally be-->
